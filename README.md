# Building Profitable Gaming Apps for iOS Mobile

The mobile games industry is worth billions of dollars, with companies spending
vast amounts of money on the development and marketing of these games to an equally
large market.

For this project, we'll pretend that we're working as data analysts for a company
that builds `iOS mobile apps`.

Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand
what type of apps are likely to attract more users.
